# Simple-Monte-Carlo

This is a simple Monte Carlo simulation to understand how the implement the algorithm into C++. The general motivation for this is to learn the C++ syntax and to understand how to implement my own simulations of well-know probability distribution functions, like Binomial, Gamma, Poisson, Exponential, and Beta distributions.
